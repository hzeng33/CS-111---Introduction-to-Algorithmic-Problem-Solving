Homework 5
1. Write a function called median that returns the median
entry in a 1-dimensional array of integers.
For example, if we have an array a={3,4,5,1,6}; then the
median entry of this array a is 4. You need to sort the array
a first, to get {1,3,4,5,6}, then find the entry in the middle
position.
If the array size is even, it means that array has even
number of elements. For example, a={3,2,4,1}, then first
sort it, a becomes {1,2,3,4}, then the median entry will be
the average of 2 and 3, which is 2.5.


2. Create a 2-dimensional array with 10 rows and 10
columns.Fill the array with random 3 digit integers. Print
out the column with the largest sum. (If two or more
columns share the largest sum, print out one of them only.)
